# Configuration guide

## Quick start

Install the plugin with OpenClaw's plugin installer:

```bash
openclaw plugins install @martian-engineering/lossless-claw
```

If you're running from a local OpenClaw checkout:

```bash
pnpm openclaw plugins install @martian-engineering/lossless-claw
```

For local development of this plugin, link your working copy:

```bash
openclaw plugins install --link /path/to/lossless-claw
```

`openclaw plugins install` handles plugin registration/enabling and slot selection automatically.

Set recommended environment variables:

```bash
export LCM_FRESH_TAIL_COUNT=32
export LCM_INCREMENTAL_MAX_DEPTH=-1
```

Restart OpenClaw.

## Tuning guide

### Context threshold

`LCM_CONTEXT_THRESHOLD` (default `0.75`) controls when compaction triggers as a fraction of the model's context window.

- **Lower values** (e.g., 0.5) trigger compaction earlier, keeping context smaller but doing more LLM calls for summarization.
- **Higher values** (e.g., 0.85) let conversations grow longer before compacting, reducing summarization cost but risking overflow with large model responses.

For most use cases, 0.75 is a good balance.

### Fresh tail count

`LCM_FRESH_TAIL_COUNT` (default `32`) is the number of most recent messages that are never compacted. These raw messages give the model immediate conversational continuity.

- **Smaller values** (e.g., 8–16) save context space for summaries but may lose recent nuance.
- **Larger values** (e.g., 32–64) give better continuity at the cost of a larger mandatory context floor.

For coding conversations with tool calls (which generate many messages per logical turn), 32 is recommended.

### Leaf fanout

`LCM_LEAF_MIN_FANOUT` (default `8`) is the minimum number of raw messages that must be available outside the fresh tail before a leaf pass runs.

- Lower values create summaries more frequently (more, smaller summaries).
- Higher values create larger, more comprehensive summaries less often.

### Condensed fanout

`LCM_CONDENSED_MIN_FANOUT` (default `4`) controls how many same-depth summaries accumulate before they're condensed into a higher-level summary.

- Lower values create deeper DAGs with more levels of abstraction.
- Higher values keep the DAG shallower but with more nodes at each level.

### Incremental max depth

`LCM_INCREMENTAL_MAX_DEPTH` (default `0`) controls whether condensation happens automatically after leaf passes.

- **0** — Only leaf summaries are created incrementally. Condensation only happens during manual `/compact` or overflow.
- **1** — After each leaf pass, attempt to condense d0 summaries into d1.
- **2+** — Deeper automatic condensation up to the specified depth.
- **-1** — Unlimited depth. Condensation cascades as deep as needed after each leaf pass. Recommended for long-running sessions.

### Summary target tokens

`LCM_LEAF_TARGET_TOKENS` (default `1200`) and `LCM_CONDENSED_TARGET_TOKENS` (default `2000`) control the target size of generated summaries.

- Larger targets preserve more detail but consume more context space.
- Smaller targets are more aggressive, losing detail faster.

The actual summary size depends on the LLM's output; these values are guidelines passed in the prompt's token target instruction.

### Leaf chunk tokens

`LCM_LEAF_CHUNK_TOKENS` (default `20000`) caps the amount of source material per leaf compaction pass.

- Larger chunks create more comprehensive summaries from more material.
- Smaller chunks create summaries more frequently from less material.
- This also affects the condensed minimum input threshold (10% of this value).

## Model selection

LCM uses the same model as the parent OpenClaw session for summarization by default. You can override this:

```bash
# Use a specific model for summarization
export LCM_SUMMARY_MODEL=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
export LCM_SUMMARY_PROVIDER=anthropic
export LCM_SUMMARY_BASE_URL=https://api.anthropic.com
```

Using a cheaper/faster model for summarization can reduce costs, but quality matters — poor summaries compound as they're condensed into higher-level nodes.

When more than one source is present, compaction summarization resolves in this order:

1. `LCM_SUMMARY_MODEL` / `LCM_SUMMARY_PROVIDER`
2. Plugin config `summaryModel` / `summaryProvider`
3. OpenClaw's default compaction model/provider
4. Legacy per-call model/provider hints

If `summaryModel` already includes a provider prefix such as `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514`, `summaryProvider` is ignored for that choice.

## Session controls

### Excluding sessions entirely

Use `ignoreSessionPatterns` or `LCM_IGNORE_SESSION_PATTERNS` to keep low-value sessions completely out of LCM. Matching sessions do not create conversations, do not store messages, and do not participate in compaction or delegated expansion grants.

- Matching uses the full session key.
- `*` matches any characters except `:`.
- `**` matches anything, including `:`.

Example:

```bash
export LCM_IGNORE_SESSION_PATTERNS=agent:*:cron:**,agent:main:subagent:**
```

### Stateless sessions

Use `statelessSessionPatterns` or `LCM_STATELESS_SESSION_PATTERNS` for sessions that should be able to read from LCM without writing to it. This is especially useful for sub-agent sessions, which use real OpenClaw keys like `agent:<agentId>:subagent:<uuid>`.

Enable enforcement with `skipStatelessSessions` or `LCM_SKIP_STATELESS_SESSIONS=true`.

When a session key matches a stateless pattern and enforcement is enabled, LCM will:

- skip bootstrap imports
- skip ingest and after-turn persistence
- skip compaction writes
- skip delegated expansion grant writes
- still allow read-side assembly from existing persisted context

Example:

```bash
export LCM_STATELESS_SESSION_PATTERNS=agent:*:subagent:**,agent:ops:subagent:**
export LCM_SKIP_STATELESS_SESSIONS=true
```

Plugin config example:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "lossless-claw": {
        "config": {
          "ignoreSessionPatterns": [
            "agent:*:cron:**"
          ],
          "statelessSessionPatterns": [
            "agent:*:subagent:**",
            "agent:ops:subagent:**"
          ],
          "skipStatelessSessions": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## TUI conversation window size

`LCM_TUI_CONVERSATION_WINDOW_SIZE` (default `200`) controls how many messages `lcm-tui` loads per keyset-paged conversation window when a session has an LCM `conversation_id`.

- Smaller values reduce render/query cost for very large conversations.
- Larger values show more context per page but increase render time.

## Database management

The SQLite database lives at `LCM_DATABASE_PATH` (default `~/.openclaw/lcm.db`). 

### Inspecting the database

```bash
sqlite3 ~/.openclaw/lcm.db

# Count conversations
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM conversations;

# See context items for a conversation
SELECT * FROM context_items WHERE conversation_id = 1 ORDER BY ordinal;

# Check summary depth distribution
SELECT depth, COUNT(*) FROM summaries GROUP BY depth;

# Find large summaries
SELECT summary_id, depth, token_count FROM summaries ORDER BY token_count DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### Backup

The database is a single file. Back it up with:

```bash
cp ~/.openclaw/lcm.db ~/.openclaw/lcm.db.backup
```

Or use SQLite's online backup:

```bash
sqlite3 ~/.openclaw/lcm.db ".backup ~/.openclaw/lcm.db.backup"
```

## Per-agent configuration

In multi-agent OpenClaw setups, each agent uses the same LCM database but has its own conversations (keyed by session ID). The plugin config applies globally; per-agent overrides use environment variables set in the agent's config.

## Disabling LCM

To fall back to OpenClaw's built-in compaction:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "slots": {
      "contextEngine": "legacy"
    }
  }
}
```

Or set `LCM_ENABLED=false` to disable the plugin while keeping it registered.
