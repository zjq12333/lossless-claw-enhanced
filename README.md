# 🦞lossless-claw-enhanced

> Enhanced fork of [Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw) — fixes CJK token estimation and cherry-picks critical upstream bug fixes for production reliability.

Lossless Context Management plugin for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw), based on the [LCM paper](https://papers.voltropy.com/LCM) from [Voltropy](https://x.com/Voltropy). Replaces OpenClaw's built-in sliding-window compaction with a DAG-based summarization system that preserves every message while keeping active context within model token limits.

## What's enhanced

### CJK-Aware Token Estimation

The upstream plugin estimates tokens using `Math.ceil(text.length / 4)`, which assumes ~4 ASCII characters per token. This severely **underestimates by 2-4x** for CJK text (Chinese/Japanese/Korean), because each CJK character maps to ~1.5 tokens in modern tokenizers (cl100k_base, o200k_base).

**Impact of the upstream bug:**
- Compaction triggers too late, causing context window overflow
- Context assembly budgets are miscalculated
- Summary target sizes are wrong
- Large file interception misses CJK-heavy files

**What we fixed:**

| Character Type | Upstream (tokens/char) | Enhanced (tokens/char) | Correction |
|---|---|---|---|
| ASCII/Latin | 0.25 | 0.25 | unchanged |
| CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) | 0.25 | 1.5 | **6x** |
| Emoji / Supplementary Plane | 0.5 | 2.0 | **4x** |

```
"这个项目的架构设计非常优秀" (14 CJK chars)
  Upstream:  ceil(14 / 4)   =  4 tokens  (wrong)
  Enhanced:  ceil(14 * 1.5) = 21 tokens  (accurate)
  Real (cl100k_base):         19 tokens
```

**Changes:**
- Shared `src/estimate-tokens.ts` with CJK/emoji-aware estimation
- Consolidated 5 duplicate `estimateTokens()` into a single import
- Idempotent migration recalculates `token_count` for existing CJK messages and summaries on upgrade (pure ASCII rows are not touched)
- 18 test cases (10 estimation + 8 migration)

### Cherry-picked Upstream Bug Fixes

| PR | Fix | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| [#178](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/178) | Prevent false-positive auth errors in `stripAuthErrors()` | Conversations discussing "401 errors" or "API keys" caused the summarizer to falsely report auth failure, aborting compaction |
| [#190](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/190) | Detect session file rotation in bootstrap | After `/reset` or session rotation, compaction never triggered on the new session — context grew unbounded |
| [#172](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/172) | Skip ingesting empty error/aborted assistant messages | API 500s produced empty messages that accumulated, creating a feedback loop that permanently broke the agent |

All cherry-picks were reviewed by OpenAI Codex with 3 additional fixes applied:
- `parent_id` → `parent_summary_id` column name correction in session rotation purge
- FTS table operations guarded with try/catch for no-FTS runtimes
- CJK migration reordered before `backfillSummaryMetadata` so derived fields use corrected values

## Install from source

This fork is not published to npm. Install directly from GitHub:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/win4r/lossless-claw-enhanced.git

# Install into OpenClaw using --link (symlink, picks up changes instantly)
openclaw plugins install --link /path/to/lossless-claw-enhanced

# Or copy-install (snapshot, won't pick up later changes)
openclaw plugins install /path/to/lossless-claw-enhanced
```

### Configure OpenClaw

After installation, set the context engine slot:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "slots": {
      "contextEngine": "lossless-claw"
    },
    "entries": {
      "lossless-claw": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "freshTailCount": 32,
          "contextThreshold": 0.75,
          "incrementalMaxDepth": -1,
          "ignoreSessionPatterns": [
            "agent:*:cron:**",
            "agent:*:subagent:**"
          ],
          "summaryModel": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart the gateway after configuration changes:

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

### Update to latest

```bash
cd /path/to/lossless-claw-enhanced
git pull origin main

# If using --link install, just restart the gateway:
openclaw gateway restart

# If using copy install, re-install:
openclaw plugins install /path/to/lossless-claw-enhanced
openclaw gateway restart
```

## Upstream compatibility

Tracks [Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw) `main` branch. To sync upstream changes:

```bash
cd /path/to/lossless-claw-enhanced
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

## What it does

When a conversation grows beyond the model's context window, OpenClaw normally truncates older messages. LCM instead:

1. **Persists every message** in a SQLite database, organized by conversation
2. **Summarizes chunks** of older messages into summaries using your configured LLM
3. **Condenses summaries** into higher-level nodes as they accumulate, forming a DAG (directed acyclic graph)
4. **Assembles context** each turn by combining summaries + recent raw messages
5. **Provides tools** (`lcm_grep`, `lcm_describe`, `lcm_expand`) so agents can search and recall details from compacted history

Nothing is lost. Raw messages stay in the database. Summaries link back to their source messages. Agents can drill into any summary to recover the original detail.

## Configuration

LCM is configured through plugin config and environment variables. Environment variables take precedence.

### Key parameters

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `LCM_CONTEXT_THRESHOLD` | `0.75` | Fraction of context window that triggers compaction |
| `LCM_FRESH_TAIL_COUNT` | `32` | Messages protected from compaction |
| `LCM_INCREMENTAL_MAX_DEPTH` | `0` | Compaction cascade depth (`-1` = unlimited) |
| `LCM_LEAF_CHUNK_TOKENS` | `20000` | Max source tokens per leaf compaction |
| `LCM_SUMMARY_MODEL` | `""` | Model override for summarization |
| `LCM_IGNORE_SESSION_PATTERNS` | `""` | Glob patterns to exclude from LCM |
| `LCM_DATABASE_PATH` | `~/.openclaw/lcm.db` | SQLite database path |

See upstream [README](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw#configuration) for the full configuration reference.
